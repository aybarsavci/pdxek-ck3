# Event fired every month to update the dynasty legacies modifiers

# This event fires the dynasty_update_legacies_modifiers_effect for each member of this list, which wipes all their modifiers and recalculates it, based on the dynasty level of Splendor
# This is a workaround, as there is no dynasty_prestige_level related on action
