# CUT, because there's no gameplay mechanic related to Alchemy
 game_concept_compendium_alchemy:0 "Alchemy"
 game_concept_compendium_alchemy_desc:0 "An art as old as time, #bold Alchemy#! is the process through which someone combines and mixes, boils, or distills several ingredients to form a poison, or a potion. This art was supposedly codified by Asliel Direnni, but most people in Tamriel already knew how boiling a plant could cure a fever, or what bones should one crush to produce a potent poison.\n\nAlchemical ingredients come in very various forms, such as plants or leaves, animal parts, undead remnants, and even Daedric summons. This makes alchemy a potentially very lucrative and very dangerous trade, as the most expensive ingredients produce the most powerful poisons and potions, but are also hidden in the most deadly places.\n\nYou can find more lore entries in the #LORE [compendium]#!."

Their joint worship as the #bold Eight Divines#! started under Alessia and her newly forged Empire, as the Elven gods and Nordic deities had to coexist in this new nation.\nAs part of the Covenant between Alessia and Akatosh, the Dragon-God of Time swore to protect Mundus from further Daedric influence as long as Alessia and her line championed the pantheon throughout Tamriel.\n\nAside from #italic Akatosh#!, the Eight Divines are composed of #italic Arkay#!, #italic Dibella#!, #italic Julianos#!, #italic Kynareth#!, #italic Mara#!, #italic Stendarr#!, and #italic Zenithar#!. Different cultures might know the individual Divines under different names. Kynareth for example is known as Kyne to the Nords and Khenarthi to the Khajiit. Other Aedra, such as Magnus or Y'ffre, are often worshipped alongside the Divines.\n\nYou can find more lore entries in the #LORE [compendium]#!."

 game_concept_compendium_missing_god_desc:0 "The #bold Missing God#! is a blanket term referring to the deity variously known as #italic Lorkhan#!, #italic Shezarr#!, #italic Shor#!, #italic Sheor#!, #italic Sep#!, #italic Lorkhaj#!, #italic Lorkh#! or #italic Tseol#!. So named because he features prominently in most cosmogonies as a casualty of creation, killed by the other gods in their anger at his trickery.\n\nHe convinced his fellow gods to join him in his project to construct a new plane. Halfway through, the Architect Magnus learned the truth of the Missing God's designs and departed, leading an exodus of gods remembered as the Magna-Ge.\n\nThe remaining gods who chose to complete the project and lost most of their powers in the process became the [Glossary( 'Aedra', 'AEDRA_GLOSS' )], the Earthbones and Ehlnofey, the latter of which would eventually become the mortal races.\n\nWhether they revere or abhor him, most agree the Missing God played a pivotal role in enabling the existence of the mortal plane, and as such life as we know it. Opinions diverge whereas the existence of mortal life is a blessing — a position held by most beliefs sympathetic or neutral towards him — or a curse — the stance of most faiths that actively see Mundus as a barrier to immortality and a fall from grace.\n\nYou can find more lore entries in the #LORE [compendium]#!."

The Elsweyr Confederacy formed in 2E 309, when King Keirgo of Anequina and Queen Eshita of Pellitine married, and for the first time in its history, Elsweyr was united. This unity did not last, and in 2E 326, the capital city of Ne Quin-al was sacked by rebellious tribal subjects of the Confederacy, and the royal family was massacred. However, peace was restored by the spiritual leader of Elsweyr, Mane Rid-Thar-ri'Datta, thanks to his newly invented system of power sharing between tribal leaders and nobles based on the phases of the moons. Soon enough, he assumed official control of the Elsweyr Confederacy and became the first Mane to rule it.\n\nYou can find more lore entries in the #LORE [compendium]#!."
