	#Default way is more realistic but not what you expect from fantasy half elves. This is not ideal either, but this makes it so children have a 25% chance
	#of being born with full mer ears,50% half ears (or somewhere in between quarter and half most likely) and 25% no mer ears. Still more immersive than one gene, but there's still a small chance of
